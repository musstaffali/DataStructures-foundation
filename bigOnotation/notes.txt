Big "O" notation allows us to compare the worst case performance of our algorithms in a standardized way.


**CTCI**
Big O time is the lanaguage and metric we use to describe the efficieny of algorithms. 

Not understanding it throughly can really hurt you in developing an algorithm. 

Not only might you be judge harshly for not realy understanding big O, 
but you will also struggle to judge when your algorithm is getting faster or slower.
