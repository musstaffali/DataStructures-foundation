/**
CTCI - 3.1
Three In One:
Describe how you could use a single array
    to implement three stacks.

Iterate through linked list getting one node at a time
Iterate through the rest of the linked list and compare the current nodeâ€™s value
When duplicate element is found, remove it from the linked list and update the linked list.


Hint
#2 
A stack is simply a data structure in which the most
recently added elements are removed first. 
Can you simulate a single stack using an array? 
Remember that there are many possible solutions, and
there are tradeoffs of each.
